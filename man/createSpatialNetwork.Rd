\description{
Create a spatial network based on cell centroid physical distances.
}
\details{
Creates a spatial network connecting single-cells based on their physical distance to each other.
Number of neighbors can be determined by k, maximum distance from each cell with or without
setting a minimum k for each cell.

\strong{dimensions: } default = 'all' which takes all possible dimensions.
Alternatively you can provide a character vector that specififies the spatial dimensions to use, e.g. c("sdimx', "sdimy")
or a numerical vector, e.g. 2:3

\strong{maximum_distance: } to create a network based on maximum distance only, you also need to set k to a very high value, e.g. k = 100
