# Giotto

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Giotto is to process, analyze and visualize **single-cell spatial transcriptomic** data. Simultaneously this package contains the data that was used in the recent [**seqFISH+**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1049-y) paper and can thus be used to explore or re-analyze this dataset.

## Requirements

- R (>= 3.5.1)
- Python (>= 3.0)
- Unix/Linux


## Installation

#### R installation

You can install the development version of Giotto with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("RubD/Giotto")
```

You can NOT YET install the released version of Giotto from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Giotto")
```

#### Python tools (optional)  
This is necessary to run all available analyses, including Leiden/Louvain clustering and [**HMRF**](http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4260) and to build and use the interactive visualization tool. An alternative, but less flexible, R version for Louvain clustering is available.

``` python
conda install GioTools
```
