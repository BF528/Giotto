# Giotto

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Giotto is to process, analyze and visualize single-cell **spatial** transcriptomic data. Simultaneously this package contains the data that was used in the recent [**seqFISH+**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1049-y) paper and can thus be used to explore or re-analyze this dataset.

## Requirements

- R (>= 3.5.1)
- Python (>= 3.0)
- Unix/Linux
